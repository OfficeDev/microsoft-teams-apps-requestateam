# Request-a-team App Template

| [Documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-requestateam/wiki/Home) | [Deployment guide](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-requestateam/wiki/Deployment-Guide) | [Architecture](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-requestateam/wiki/Solution-Overview) | [Teams Templates](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-requestateam/wiki/Teams-Templates)

Enterprise organizations have expressed a need to standardize and to promote best practices around the creation of new team instances. The **Request-a-team** App Template supports these goals by providing a framework that automates the team creation process based on core features and channel options which are relevant to optimizing usage. This enables faster response time for team requests and offers a wealth of personalization options for organizations to implement repeatable best practices on team collaboration. 

 - Easy to use team request form for the collection of team scope, stakeholders (owners and members), and business justifications for new team instances 

 - Embedded approval process for approval and/or rejection of requests submitted 

 - Requestor and approver dashboards showing past and current requests with status 

 - Automated team builds on approval, including creating new instances based on existing teams and channels

### 4-Step request process wizard: 

1. From a Microsoft Teams tab in a channel, end-users will use an easy 4-step wizard process to request new team instances, providing required details such as unique team name, owners, and scope (private, public), supplementary business questions give approvers the context they need for responding to requests  

2. Once the request is submitted, an adaptive card will be posted to the designated team channel where approvers and admins will act upon the request 

3. Once a request is approved by the app admins, the Azure Logic Apps service, which runs on periodic intervals, will provision the team using [Microsoft Graph APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-concept-overview). The end-users and app admins will be able to track status of each request within the app.

**Extending and optimizing the value of the Request-a-team App template**: 

End users can reference existing teams instances as templates during the request process. This is a great opportunity for the organization to build and promote previously tested team structures and services that best meet the desired departmental or information worker business outcomes (also see [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-team-from-an-existing-team-f41a759b-3101-4af6-93bd-6aba0e5d7635?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)). This means that the **Request-a-team** App template works right out-of-the-box to help in promoting and enabling everyone to reuse best practices to drive faster outcomes.
